Gems which you women use\nAre like Atlanta's ball cast in men's views;\nThat, when a fool's eye lighteth on a gem,\nHis earthly soul might court that, not them.\nLike pictures, or like books' gay coverings made\nFor laymen, are all women thus array'd.\nThemselves are only mystic books, which we\nWhom their imputed grace will dignify\nMust see reveal'd. Then, since that I may know,\nAs liberally as to thy midwife show\nThyself ; cast all, yea, this white linen hence;\nThere is no penance due to innocence:\nTo teach thee, I am naked first; why then,\nWhat needst thou have more covering than a man?"
