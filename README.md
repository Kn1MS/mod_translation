## Compatibility

This mod requires [Carnalitas](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/14207-carnalitas-unified-sex-mod-framework-for-ck3/) as a prerequisite (obviously). While it modifies the *Make Love* interaction and its related effects in a substantial way, it doesn't touch other Carnalitas features and should be compatible with all of them.

### Compatibility with Mods Based on Carnalitas

This mod was explicitly designed to be compatible with [Carnalitas Slavery Reimagined](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/25565-carnalitas-slavery-reimagined/), so you are encouraged to use them both. They don't depend on each other in any way however.

This mod should be compatible with all mods based on Carnalitas that don't modify the *Make Love* interaction, or enhance it in a way that is supported by Carnalitas, e.g. add additional sex scenes. Compatibility with the following mods has been explicitly verified, but most others should work as well:

* [Character Body Overhaul](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/16683-character-body-overhaul/)
* [Physical Attributes](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/16927-physical-attributes/)
* [Intimate Stories](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/27533-intimate-stories/)
* [Carnalitas Slavery Expansion](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/21651-carnalitas-slavery-expansion/).
